### What's this?
It's a "simple" starter template for creating advanced discord bots using [discord.py]([https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)). There's a bit of a learning curve when it comes to using this template, unfortunately it's not documented cause I'm too lazy to write a documentation for it :>.

This template is basically [this template]([https://github.com/SourSpoon/Discord.py-Template](https://github.com/SourSpoon/Discord.py-Template)) but on steroids and much worse, so yeah good luck using it.
